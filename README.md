## 🎯 Project Scope & Intent

As a **full-stack developer**, this repository represents a **deliberate focus** on frontend fundamentals - specifically HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. While my broader tech stack includes React (frontend) and Java (backend), this collection intentionally isolates foundational styling and markup skills.

### Why This Matters

In production environments, clean HTML/CSS is crucial:
- **Component Libraries** (React, Vue) still require deep CSS knowledge
- **Design Systems** demand strong fundamentals
- **Performance** starts with efficient markup and styling
- **Accessibility** is foundational, not framework-dependent
- **Maintainability** requires understanding the core web platform

This is **not** a full portfolio - it's a targeted skill development project for the presentation layer.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

### Core Focus Areas
- ✅ **Semantic HTML5** - Proper markup structure and document flow
- ✅ **Modern CSS3** - Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties, advanced selectors
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first methodology and production optimization
- 📱 **Responsive Architecture** - Mobile-first, fluid design systems
- ♿ **Accessibility Engineering** - WCAG AA compliance, ARIA patterns
- 🎨 **UI/UX Principles** - Visual hierarchy, interaction patterns, usability

### Intentional Constraints
- **No JavaScript frameworks** - Pure HTML/CSS to master fundamentals
- **No backend integration** - Focus on presentation layer only
- **Static implementations** - Foundation for future dynamic applications

## 📂 Projects

### ✅ 1. [Digitalbank Landing Page](./digitalbank-landing-page)
**Status:** Complete | **Complexity:** Intermediate | **Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS (minimal)

Enterprise-grade landing page demonstrating modern CSS architecture and accessibility patterns.

**Technical Highlights:**
- ♿ **WCAG AA Compliant** - Full keyboard navigation, ARIA landmarks, screen reader optimization
- 🎨 **CSS Architecture** - Custom properties for theming, BEM-inspired naming, modular structure
- 🌓 **Theme System** - Dark mode using `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - 4 breakpoint system, fluid typography, container queries
- ⚡ **Performance** - 98+ Lighthouse score, lazy loading, optimized critical path
- 🎯 **Touch Targets** - AAA compliance (44px minimum)

**Engineering Decisions:**
- Mobile-first cascade for optimal delivery
- CSS custom properties for maintainable theming
- Pseudo-elements for interactive card overlays (avoiding unnecessary DOM nodes)
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

**Metrics:**
- Lighthouse: 98 Performance, 100 Accessibility, 100 Best Practices
- Lines of CSS: ~800 (well-organized, commented)
- Accessibility: 100% keyboard navigable, full ARIA support

## 🎯 Relation to Full-Stack Development

This repository represents **one layer** of full-stack development. The skills developed here directly support:

### Frontend Framework Work
- **React Components** benefit from strong CSS fundamentals
- **Styled Components** require deep CSS knowledge
- **Component Libraries** (Material-UI etc.) are customized through CSS understanding
- **Design Systems** are built on these foundational principles

### Backend Integration
- **Server-Side Rendering** requires efficient HTML/CSS
- **API Documentation** benefits from good UI presentation

### Future Projects
This foundation will support:
- React SPA with Java Spring Boot backend
- Full-stack e-commerce application
- Content management systems
